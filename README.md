Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project Using Python:

Overview: This project involves performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns in the data related to the passengers of the Titanic, such as survival rates, demographic information, and relationships between various attributes.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For basic plotting.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations.

Key Components:

Data Collection and Loading:

Description: The dataset contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, including features such as passenger class, sex, age, fare, and whether they survived.

Tools Used: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Description: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Methods:

Handling missing values by imputation or removal.

Converting categorical variables to numerical values.

Correcting data types and formatting issues.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Description: Analyzing various attributes of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.

Techniques:

Descriptive Statistics: Using Pandas to calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).

Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to illustrate the distribution of data and relationships between variables.

Analysis Components:

Survival Rate: Calculating the overall survival rate.

Visualization: Pie chart showing the proportion of survivors and non-survivors.

Passenger Class Analysis: Analyzing the survival rate by passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

Visualization: Bar chart showing survival rates by class.

Gender Analysis: Analyzing the survival rate by gender.

Visualization: Bar chart showing survival rates by gender.

Age Distribution: Analyzing the age distribution of passengers and its relation to survival.

Visualization: Histogram of age distribution, overlayed with survival status.

Fare Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of fares and its relation to survival.

Visualization: Box plot of fares by passenger class, colored by survival.

Embarkation Analysis: Analyzing survival rates by embarkation points (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton).

Visualization: Bar chart of survival rates by embarkation point.
